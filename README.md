# How to run this App

Clone the project to your local machine from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Technology stack

**TeamPhixit** makes use of a host of modern technologies. The core ones are:

-   Nextjs: This project makes use of the Nextjs a frame of Reactjs(Javascript library) to build the interface. Nextjs is used for building web pages that are structured as a collection of components. For more information about See [this link](https://nextjs.org).
-   ECMAScript 6: Also known as ES2015, this is a version of Javascript with
    next-generation features like arrow functions, generators, enhanced object literals,
    spread operators and more. The ES2015 is used in many areas of this project. See [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) for details.
-   Typescript
-   SCSS
-   Major codes are written using the Airbnb javascript style guide, see [this link](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for details.
